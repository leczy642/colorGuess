# colorguess
A color guessing game built with vanilla Javascript

Colorguess is an RGB color guessing game built with vanilla Javascript. The aim of the game is to make sure the RGB color selected matches 
the RGB value displayed on the browser. The game has 2 modes: easy and hard. For the easy mode you only have up to 6 guesses and the hard mode
only allows 2 guesses. 

Javascript event listeners were programmed into this game to listen for click events that activates a counter that notes the number of times an element is clicked. 

There is also a function that generates random RGB values which are displayed in the browser visually as colors.
